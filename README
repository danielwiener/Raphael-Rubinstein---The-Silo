Theme Name: The Silo
Theme URI: http://danielwiener.com/
Description: The Silo, a theme, for Raphael Rubinstein's archive of descriptions of artists from the last 40 years. The Silo is conceived as a personal, revisionist “dictionary” of contemporary art. Its primary aims are to challenge existing exclusionary accounts of art since 1960 and to offer a fresh look at some canonical artists.
This is a cumulative project; new entries will appear with as much regularity as circumstances allow.
The front page will be exclusively names and no text
